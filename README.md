# StockLandMatchingEngine(SLME)
This program is an 'Order Matching System' developed by `amirmasp` as a seperate module that will be integrated to the [StockLand Exchange Application](https://github.com/amirmasp/StockLandFinal) .

Note: SLME can keep track of orders from other market makers as well, and executes them properly.

This simulation app shows how a matching engine at an exchange(StockLand) works.
